# CO2-Dashboard

Interactive dashboard using Python and Panel.

Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of climate change. In order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to immediately reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of international discussions.
<br>This dashboard helps us understand the contribution of different regions and types of CO2 emissions.
